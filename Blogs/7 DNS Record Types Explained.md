DNS stands for Domain Name System


## Topics to Cover

1. What DNS is (explained in very simple terms)
    
2. Why DNS records are needed
    
3. What an **NS Record** is (who is responsible for a domain)
    
4. What an **A Record** is (domain → IPv4 address)
    
5. What an **AAAA Record** is (domain → IPv6 address)
    
6. What a **CNAME Record** is (one name pointing to another name)
    
7. What an **MX Record** is (how emails find your mail server)
    
8. What a **TXT Record** is (extra information and verification)
    
9. How all DNS records work together for one website
    

## Suggestions

1. Start with the question: _“How does a browser know where a website lives?”_
    
2. Explain DNS as the **phonebook of the internet**
    
3. Introduce **one record at a time**, no jumping
    
4. Use simple, real-life examples (house address, contact name, post office)
    
5. Avoid deep protocol or RFC language
    
6. Explain **what problem each record solves**, not just definitions
    
7. Show how a single domain uses multiple records together
    
8. Clear common beginner confusion gently:
    
    - A vs CNAME
        
    - NS vs MX
        
9. Keep language conversational and reassuring
    

## Diagram Ideas

1. Browser → DNS → Server (high-level flow)
    
2. Domain name to IP mapping using A / AAAA records
    
3. CNAME pointing one domain name to another
    
4. Email routing using MX records
    
5. Simple DNS hierarchy showing NS records
    
6. One complete DNS setup for a small website
