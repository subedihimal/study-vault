#### Why Version Control Exists ?
Lets say, A developer decided to make  a personal project. He setup the project in his computer and start writing code. In the  beginning the code was of few lines. He didn't have any issue keeping track of what changes he made, at times when he faced a bug or an error he could easily debug. Everything was working fine at the beginning. After a month or so, his consistency paid off and the project grew to have thousands of lines of code. Now, a new problem arose if he faced a bug or wanted to add some experimental feature, and things didn't work out, he would have hard time changing back all the thousands of lines of code to the time everything worked fine.
Finding solution to this problem led to the development and the existence of **version control system**.


#### The Pendrive Analogy in Software Development

Lets  imagine you are working on your next big app "Tinder But  for Dogs". The project is a huge success and u need to add a payment feature to earn some money for the hard work. You don't know how to build the payment feature and u ask your good friend Tommy for some help. Now, you  have to provide the source code to Tommy. You think for a while and get a brilliant idea to use a USB pen-drive,  what could go wrong ? right,  Well as brilliant as the solution may sound, like the "Tinder but for dogs" idea u had, here are some problems that may occur.
- You will need to physically move the pen drive from your house to your friends every-time u make and update and vice-versa.
- Both you and Tommy wont be able to work on the project in parallel as if  u do so there will be two different project with different  things implemented and you will have a hard time merging both.
- You wont know what changes were made by each other (collaboration history).

So, these were the problem faced before a proper version control system existed
