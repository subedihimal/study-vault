Git allows you to track different versions of a project over time.

- **`git init`**  
  Initializes Git in the current folder and creates a `.git` directory where all version history is stored.

- **`git add`**  
  Stages files by taking a *snapshot* of their current state.  
  → Does **not** save changes permanently.

- **`git commit`**  
  Saves the staged changes to the project history with a commit message.

- **`git log`**  
  Displays the commit history with details like commit ID, author, and date.

- **`git status`**  
  Shows:
  - Staged files
  - Modified but unstaged files
  - Untracked files

- **`git diff <old_commit> <new_commit>`**  
  Shows the differences between two commits.
